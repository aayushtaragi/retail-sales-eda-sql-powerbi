# 🛍️ Retail Sales EDA Using SQL

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project performs a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset using MS SQL Server. The objective is to analyze customer behavior, sales patterns, and product performance to uncover trends and support business decision-making.

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **MS SQL Server**: For all data cleaning, transformations, and analysis  
- **Power BI** *(optional if you used it)*: For visual dashboard (not covered in SQL)

## 🎯 Key Analysis Tasks  
- Data quality check (nulls, invalid entries)  
- Top customer analysis by total spending  
- Product performance by category  
- Age & gender-based spending patterns  
- Monthly and quarterly sales trends  
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, SD)  
- Rolling average of sales  
- Sales growth rate month over month  

## 🔍 Key Business Insights  
- **Product Categories**: [Insert top 2-3 here if known] generated the most revenue  
- **Age Groups 30–45** had the highest spending, with male customers showing slightly higher average order values  
- **Q4 consistently showed higher sales**, suggesting seasonal trends  
- Descriptive statistics help in understanding variability and central tendencies in sales
