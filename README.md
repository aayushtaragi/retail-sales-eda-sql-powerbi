# 🛍️ Retail Sales Data – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Using SQL

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset using MS SQL Server. The dataset contains customer demographics, transaction details, product categories, and order dates. The goal is to explore patterns and generate business-relevant insights such as customer spending behavior, seasonal trends, and category performance.

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **MS SQL Server**: For data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis
- **POWER BI**: Visualization

## 🎯 Key Analysis Performed  
- Checked for null or missing values in important columns  
- Identified top 10 customers based on total sales  
- Aggregated sales by product category  
- Found highest and lowest MRP in each category  
- Grouped customers by age ranges and gender to analyze spending trends  
- Analyzed order dates to determine first and last purchase by category  
- Calculated monthly and quarterly sales trends  
- Computed 7-day rolling average of sales  
- Generated descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) on sales

## 📊 Key Insights  
- **Technology and Fashion** categories showed the highest revenue  
- **Age group 30–45** had the most purchase activity  
- Sales increased during **Q3 and Q4**, indicating seasonal growth  
- Most spending came from **male customers**, but females had more purchases in some segments  
- Descriptive statistics revealed wide variation in transaction values
